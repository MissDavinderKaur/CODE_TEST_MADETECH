# CODE_TEST_MADETECH

##Overview
The objective of this code test is to build a basic blogging service. A user should be able to see a timeline of blogs, post a new blog (as long as it is less than 150 characters long) and finally delete blogs in the timeline.


##How it works
Run ```npm i```
Run ```node app/db/seed```
Ensure ```mongod``` and ```nodemon``` are running
The app runs in the browser on localhost:3000

## How to run the tests
Run ```npm test```
Run ```npm run test-e2e
