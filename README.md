# CODE_TEST_MADETECH

## Overview
The objective of this code test is to build a basic blogging service. A user should be able to see a timeline of blogs, post a new blog (as long as it is less than 150 characters long) and finally delete blogs in the timeline.


## How it works
1) Run ```npm i```
2) Run ```node app/db/seed```
3) Ensure ```mongod``` and ```nodemon``` are running
4) The app runs in the browser on localhost:3000

## How to run the tests
* For unit tests, run ```npm test```
* For browser tests, run ```npm run test-e2e```
